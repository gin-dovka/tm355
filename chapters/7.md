## Introduction

- Focuses on **access and core networks** as well as **mobile and nomadic communications**.
- Covers **network protocols, core network infrastructure, and mobile communication generations**.

## Access and Core Networks

### Core Network and Access Network
- **Core Network**: High-speed backbone interconnecting different networks.
- **Access Network**: Connects users to the core via various technologies:
  - **Copper telephone wires**
  - **Coaxial cable**
  - **Optical fibre**
  - **Mobile radio communications**
  - **WiFi (nomadic radio communications)**

### Public Switched Telecommunications Network (PSTN)
- The **PSTN trunk network** carries telephony and data traffic.
- Uses a **hierarchical system of exchanges**.
- A **splitter** at local exchanges separates **voice and data traffic**.
- **DSLAM or MSAN** multiplexes data before entering the core network.
- **Broadband Remote Access Server (BRAS)** aggregates user connections.

### Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
- **All-IP network** implementation.
- Benefits of MPLS:
  - **Quality of Service (QoS)** prioritization.
  - **Fast forwarding of packets** using labels.
  - **Efficient VPN and VoIP management.**
  - **Traffic engineering** for network optimization.

### Network Protocols and Layers
- Protocols manage **connection setup, routing, data transfer, and termination**.
- Networks are structured in **layers** to maintain modularity and interoperability.
