## Introduction

- Despite the rise of **mobile and WiFi communications**, fixed-line communications remain crucial.
- **Radio spectrum is limited**, so fixed-line infrastructure is essential for broadband access.
- Many mobile base stations **rely on fixed-line communications** for network connectivity.

## Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)

### The Local Loop
- **Copper pair connection** between the **exchange and end user**.
- Provides a **point-to-point unshared connection**.
- Also called **subscriber line, copper pair, twisted pair**.
- Problems:
  - **Crosstalk** from bundled cables.
  - **Signal reflections** from physical discontinuities.
  - **Oxidation and moisture** degrade connections.
  - **Long conductors act as antennas** for interference.
  - **Signal attenuation** on long lines reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

### Asymmetric DSL (ADSL)
- **Higher download speeds** than upload speeds.
- Variants:
  - **ADSL2, ADSL2+** (improved speed and range).
  - **VDSL (Very High-Speed DSL)** replacing ADSL in many regions.
- **XDSL**: General term for DSL variations.

### Crosstalk Issues
- **Near-End Crosstalk (NEXT):**
  - Signals from different wires interfere **at the same end**.
  - Strong interference due to overlapping frequency bands.
- **Far-End Crosstalk (FEXT):**
  - Occurs at the **receiver end**, weaker than NEXT.
- **Vectoring:**
  - Cancels out crosstalk using **signal processing**.
  - Improves **VDSL** performance.

### Discrete Multitone Transmission (DMT)
- Uses **OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)**.
- Subcarriers divide frequency into **bins**.
- Each bin is allocated a **portion of the available bandwidth**.

### G.fast
- Delivers **150 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s**.
- Achieves high data rates by:
  - **Shortening the copper loop**.
  - **Increasing frequency range (up to 106 MHz)**.

### Microfilters
- **Separate telephone signals from DSL signals**.
- Contains **low-pass and high-pass filters** to prevent interference.

## Optical Fibre in the Access Network

### Passive Optical Networks (PONs)
- **No electronic components**; only passive optical splitters.
- More economical and flexible than active networks.
- Splitting ratios (e.g., 1:2, 1:4, 1:8, up to 1:64).
- **Signal loss per splitter:**
  - **1:2 splitter → 3 dB loss**.
  - **1:4 splitter → 6 dB loss**.
  - **1:8 splitter → 9 dB loss**.
