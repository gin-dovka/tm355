## Introduction

- Previous discussions considered **isolated communication links**.
- In reality, **noise and interference** are always present and impact performance.
- This session explores their **effects in real-world communications**.

## Noise and Interference

### Sources of Noise and Interference
- **Unwanted AM/FM radio stations.**
- **Mobile phone interference** with nearby electronics.
- **Household appliances and power tools.**
- **Natural sources** such as electrical storms and solar activity.
- **Receiver-generated noise.**

### Distinguishing Noise from Interference
- **Noise**: Unavoidable, from natural sources.
- **Interference**: Caused by unwanted transmissions.

### Methods to Avoid Mutual Interference
- Use **different frequencies**.
- **Reuse frequencies** in separate locations.
- **Transmit at different times**.
- **Antenna design** strategies:
  - Different **polarizations** (horizontal vs vertical).
  - **Directional antennas** to focus signals.

### Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)
- Ensures electrical devices comply with standards:
  - **Emissions**: Limits on power radiation.
  - **Immunity**: Device must function under external radio waves.

## Mobility and Urban Environments

### Fading
- **Slow fading**: Large movement required to change signal.
- **Fast fading**: Small position shifts cause major signal variation.
- **Obstacles and reflections** create fading effects.

### Doppler Shift
- **Occurs when transmitter and receiver move relative to each other.**
- Moving **toward** each other: Higher frequency.
- Moving **away**: Lower frequency.
- Formula:
  
$$f_r = f_t \left(1 + \frac{v}{c}\right)$$

### Frequency Reuse in Mobile Networks
- Allows **efficient use of limited spectrum**.
- **Inverse fourth-power law** limits interference over distance.
- Use of **directional antennas** improves frequency allocation.

## Multiple Antennas and MIMO

### Benefits of Multiple Antennas
- **Improves reception and reduces fading.**
- **Beamforming**: Focuses signal on target receiver.
- **Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO)**: Uses multiple antennas for higher data rates.
- Used in **4G LTE, WiFi (802.11ac, 802.11n).**

## Noise and Signal Power

### Power Calculation
- Power **measured in watts (W)**.
- **Power density** formula:
  
  $$\text{Power Density} = \frac{\text{Total Power}}{\text{Bandwidth}}$$

### Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
- $SNR = \frac{\text{Signal Power}}{\text{Noise Power}}$.
- Higher SNR **reduces data loss** and improves transmission quality.
- Expressed in **decibels (dB)**.

## Noise and Data Rate

### The Sampling Theorem
- A signal can be reconstructed if sampled at **at least 2x its highest frequency**.
- **Failure to meet this rate results in aliasing** (incorrect reconstruction).

### Data Rate in a Noise-Free Channel
- **Nyquist Rate:**
  
  $D = 2B \log_2 M$
  
  where:
  - \( D \) = max data rate (bits per second).
  - \( B \) = channel bandwidth (Hz).
  - \( M \) = number of distinct symbols.
- **Higher-order QAM (e.g., 16-QAM, 64-QAM)** increases efficiency.

### Data Rate in a Noisy Channel (Shannon’s Equation)
- **Shannon’s Capacity Formula:**
  
 $C = W \log_2 \left(1 + \frac{S}{N} \right)$
  
  where:
  - \( C \) = max channel capacity (bps).
  - \( W \) = bandwidth (Hz).
  - \( $\frac{S}{N}$ \) = signal-to-noise ratio.

## Noise and Bit Error Rate (BER)
- $BER = \frac{\text{Bits in Error}}{\text{Total Transmitted Bits}}$
- **Higher noise = more bit errors.**
- **Increasing signal power reduces BER.**

## Spectrum Management

### Need for Spectrum Planning
- **Many competing spectrum users**:
  - Broadcasters, mobile networks, radar, satellites, etc.
- **Interference concerns across borders.**

### Key Considerations for Spectrum Allocation
- **Line-of-sight requirements.**
- **Lower-frequency bands limit bandwidth.**
- **Satellite communication requires transparent ionospheric windows.**
