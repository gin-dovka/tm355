## Mobile and Nomadic Communications

### Mobility vs. Nomadicity
- **Mobile communication**: Seamless handover between network nodes.
- **Nomadic communication**: Requires manual reconnection when moving (e.g., WiFi).

### Mobile Network Generations
- **3G and 4G networks differ in core structure and signal handling.**
- **3G (WCDMA)**: Hierarchical, radio network controlled by RNC.
- **4G (LTE)**: Flat, **IP-based**, more efficient in resource allocation.

### Multiple Access Techniques
- **3G uses WCDMA**, allowing multiple users on the same frequency band.
- **4G/LTE uses OFDMA**, offering higher data rates and efficiency.
- **Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) vs. Time Division Duplexing (TDD)**.
  - **FDD**: Separate bands for uplink and downlink.
  - **TDD**: Shared frequency, alternating transmission.

## 3G: Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA)

### WCDMA Features
- Soft handover between cells.
- Higher capacity compared to **TDMA-based 2G networks**.

### Channelisation Codes
- Data is **spread across a wider frequency** using **orthogonal codes**.
- Two types of codes:
  - **Channelisation Codes**: Separate multiple users.
  - **Scrambling Codes**: Reduce interference.

### Orthogonality of Codes
- Codes must be **mutually orthogonal** for effective signal separation.
- **Walsh Codes**: Used for channelisation encoding.

### Spreading Factor
- **Spreading factor (SF)**: Number of chips per transmitted bit.
- Higher SF = **Lower bit rate, higher robustness**.

## Scrambling Codes

### Purpose of Scrambling
- Ensures **low interference between adjacent cells**.
- Provides **security and privacy**.


## Fourth-Generation Mobile Communications (4G)

> [!NOTE]
> This is the start of [Session 11 slides](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AqxAKvx2i8TygQsTtpPfZWkv9cpl?e=UNd05X)

### Overview
- **Downlink data rates**: 100 Mbit/s (mobile) and 1 Gbit/s (stationary users).
- Uses **Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)** for radio access.
- Key benefits:
  - Greater **spectral efficiency**.
  - Lower **latency**.
  - Higher **maximum data rates**.
- Some **USA operators** initially marketed **WiMAX** as ‘4G’.
- **WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access)** follows the **IEEE 802.16** standard.

### LTE Evolution
- **Started as 3G LTE**, later renamed **4G LTE**.
- Often referred to as just **‘LTE’**.
- Uses an **all-IP core network**:
  - All **user data** is conveyed as **IP packets**.
  - Supports **prioritization and routing** by operators.

## Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA)

### Fundamentals
- **OFDMA** is the primary access method for LTE **downlink**.
- The uplink uses a **modified approach** based on **single-carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA)**.

### Applications of OFDM/OFDMA
- Used in various communication technologies:
  - **WiFi (except 802.11b)**.
  - **Digital TV broadcasting**.
  - **Powerline and cable TV communications**.
  - **Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB)**.
- **Allows flexible scheduling**: Resources can be dynamically assigned per user.

## Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)

### Comparison with FDM
- **FDM** separates signals in frequency.
- **OFDM** distributes a single information stream across multiple **subcarriers**.
- **Multicarrier modulation** reduces interference.

### Subcarrier Characteristics
- **Closely packed subcarriers** (hundreds to thousands).
- Offers significant **bandwidth savings** and **higher spectral efficiency**.

### Orthogonality of OFDM
- **Adjacent subcarriers overlap** but remain **orthogonal**.
- Ensures **data recovery without corruption**.

### Symbol Period and Subcarrier Spacing
- **Orthogonality condition**:
  $$ \Delta f = \frac{1}{T_{us}} $$
  where **\( T_{us} \)** is the useful symbol period.
- Close subcarrier spacing enables **efficient bandwidth usage**.

## Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) and Cyclic Prefix

### ISI in OFDM
- Caused by **multipath propagation**.
- Overlapping symbols introduce **errors**.

### Cyclic Prefix (CP)
- **Copy of symbol end added to the start**.
- Eliminates **ISI** at the cost of **reduced data rate**:
  $$ T_{OFDM} = T_{cp} + T_{us} $$
  where **\( T_{OFDM} \)** is the total OFDM symbol period.

## OFDMA and Resource Blocks

### Multi-User Scheduling
- **OFDM vs. OFDMA**:
  - OFDM is **single-user** per frequency band.
  - OFDMA **allocates subchannels dynamically**.
- **Resource blocks** are assigned based on:
  - **User requirements**.
  - **Wireless link quality**.
  - **Traffic demand**.

## LTE Uplink and SC-FDMA

### Challenges with OFDMA Uplink
1. **High peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)**:
   - Makes amplifier design costly and inefficient.
2. **Loss of subcarrier orthogonality due to mobility**:
   - Causes signal distortion.

### Solution: SC-FDMA
- Hybrid of **single-carrier transmission** and **OFDMA**.
- Uses same **subchannels and resource blocks** as LTE downlink.

## Synchronization and Reference Signals

### Importance of Synchronization
- Ensures proper timing between base station and users.
- Prevents **loss of subcarrier orthogonality**.
- Reference signals (pilot signals) aid in **channel equalization**.

## WiFi (Wireless Local Area Networks - WLAN)

### Overview
- WiFi follows the **IEEE 802.11 family of standards**.
- Two operating modes:
  1. **Infrastructure mode**: Uses an **access point (AP)** for connections.
  2. **Ad-hoc mode**: Direct communication between devices (rarely used).

### Access Point Functions
- Connects users to the **internet**.
- Provides **security via authentication and encryption**.
- **Home routers** integrate:
  - **Access point**.
  - **Router**.
  - **Modem**.
  - **Switch**.

## WiFi Spectrum and Frequency Bands

### 2.4 GHz Band
- **Unlicensed ISM band**.
- Used by multiple technologies (WiFi, Bluetooth, baby monitors, etc.).
- Divided into **22 MHz-wide channels**.
- Limited **capacity** due to interference.

### 5 GHz Band
- Offers **more spectrum** and **less congestion**.
- Split into **Bands A, B, and C** for different applications.
- Provides **higher data rates** than 2.4 GHz WiFi.

## Calculating Maximum Transmission Rate

### OFDM Symbol Rate Calculation
- For **802.11a/g**, subcarrier spacing:
  $$ \frac{1}{312.5 \times 10^3} = 3.2 \mu s $$
- With cyclic prefix:
  $$ T_{OFDM} = 3.2 \mu s + 0.8 \mu s = 4 \mu s $$
- OFDM symbol rate:
  $$ \frac{1}{4 \times 10^{-6}} = 250,000 \text{ symbols/sec} $$

### Data Rate Calculation
- Highest modulation: **64-QAM** (6 bits/symbol).
- **Bits per second per subchannel**:
  $$ 250,000 \times 6 = 1.5 \text{ Mbit/s} $$
- **After coding (3/4 rate)**:
  $$ 0.75 \times 1.5 = 1.125 \text{ Mbit/s} $$
- **Effective subchannels (48 out of 64 used):**
  $$ 48 \times 1.125 = 54 \text{ Mbit/s} $$

### Improving Transmission Rates
- Increased **modulation order**.
- **Wider spectrum usage**.
- **MIMO technology**.
- **Frame aggregation**.
