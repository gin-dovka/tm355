## Introduction

### Basic Communication System
- A communication system consists of a **transmitter**, a **channel**, and a **receiver**.
- This section focuses on the **physical channel**: properties of optical fibre, copper cable, and radio waves behaviour.
- Each transmission medium has **advantages and limitations**.
- Communication systems ensure that the correct sender communicates with the correct recipient.

### Examples of Communication Networks
- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: A network covering a small area, such as a company site.
- **Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)**: The traditional telephone network.

> Figure 1.1 distinguishes between the access network (the local exchange and its connections to the subscribers it serves) and the core network, which is everything beyond the local exchange. 

### Access and Core Networks
- The **technical demands** of access and core networks differ.
- The **access network** connects subscribers to the local exchange.
    - It  may serve millions of subscribers, each on a different site, but with only short distances involved. 
- The **core network** connects exchanges and carries traffic over long distances.
    - trunk lines in the core network carry multiple calls between two places that may be hundreds of miles apart.


### Transmission Media Evolution
- Initially, **copper cables** carried signals as electrical voltages.
- **Optical fibre** was later introduced, carrying messages using **light rays**.
- **Optical fibre predominates** in the core network, while copper is common in the access network.

### Mobile Communication Systems
- Mobile systems use **radio waves**.
- Common transmitters include **radio masts, mobile phones, and WiFi routers**.
- Unlike cables, radio waves **spread over a wide area**, leading to challenges in **signal selection and security**.

## Analogue and Digital Signals

### Definition of Signals
- A **signal** is the form in which a message is sent along a communications channel.
- In **copper cables**, signals are **electrical voltages**.
- In **optical fibre and radio**, signals are **electromagnetic waves**.

### Analogue vs. Digital Signals
- **Analogue signals**: Continuous signals that vary over time (e.g., voice signals in a telephone).
- **Digital signals**: Discrete signals with two states (1s and 0s), used in computer networks.

<img src="/assets/images/session-1-figure-[1.2]-SignalExamples.png" style="margin:auto">

> - Figure 1.2(a) illustrates part of a speech signal as produced by the microphone in a telephone. 
The voltage signal follows the air vibrations and is called an analogue signal because the voltage is analogous to the fluctuating air pressure.
> - Figure 1.2(b) represents a data signal as might be seen on a cable to a computer on a LAN (such a connection between a home PC and a router.)

## Benefits of Transmitting Digital Signals
- Signals **attenuate** (weaken) and **distort** over distance.
    - This is illustrated in Figure 1.3 for both an analogue signal and a digital signal. 
- **Digital signals** can be **regenerated**, removing distortion, unlike analogue signals.
- **Digital technology** enables transmission of voice, music, and video using a common format.

## Converting Analogue to Digital
- **Analogue-to-Digital Converters (ADCs)** convert signals for digital transmission.
- The process involves **sampling, quantisation, and encoding**.
- Higher **bit depth** improves accuracy, but increases data size.

<img src="/assets/images/session-1-figure-[1.5]-SamplingAnalogue.png" style="margin:auto">

## Analysing Signals

### Sinusoids
- **Sinusoids** are important due to their natural occurrence and mathematical simplicity.
- A **sinusoidal wave** repeats at regular intervals, defined by its **period, frequency, and amplitude**.
- Frequency is measured in **hertz (Hz)**.

<img src="/assets/images/session-1-figure-[1.6]-SinusoidalSignal.png" style="margin:auto">

### Other Periodic Signals
- **Fourier Analysis** shows that any periodic signal can be expressed as a sum of **sinusoids**.
- The **frequency domain** represents signals as sinusoidal components.
- Harmonics are higher-frequency sinusoids that make up complex waveforms.

<img src="/assets/images/session-1-figure-[1.7]-PeriodicWaves.png" style="margin:auto">

### Non-periodic Signals
- **Non-periodic (aperiodic) signals** have continuous frequency components.
- Examples include **speech and music**, which do not repeat endlessly.

<img src="/assets/images/session-1-figure-[1.8]-FrequencyDomain.png" style="margin:auto">

## Optical Fibre

<img src="/assets/images/session-1-figure-[1.10]-OpticalFiber-link.png" style="margin:auto">

## Electromagnetic Radiation
- Includes **radio waves, light, infrared, and ultraviolet radiation**.
- **Electromagnetic waves** consist of interdependent **electric and magnetic fields**.
- Waves travel at the **speed of light $(c = 3 × 10^8 \hphantom\ m/s)$** in free space.

<img src="/assets/images/session-1-figure-[1.13]-EMWave.png" style="margin:auto">

## Wavelength and Frequency
- **Wavelength** is the distance between two consecutive peaks.
- **Frequency** measures the number of cycles per second.
- Relationship: `c = λ × f` (speed of light = wavelength × frequency).

## The Electromagnetic Spectrum
- Includes **radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays**.
- Different applications use different parts of the spectrum.

<img src="/assets/images/session-1-figure-[1.14]-EMSpectrum.png" style="margin:auto">

## Light Waves in Optical Fibre
- Light travels **slower in glass** than in free space.
- **Speed in a medium**: `v = c/n`, where `n` is the **refractive index**.
- **Total Internal Reflection** allows light to travel along the fibre without escaping.

<img src="/assets/images/session-1-figure-[1.15]-LightWaves.png" style="margin:auto">

## Types of Fibre
- **Multimode Fibre**:
  - Large core diameter (~50 µm).
  - Allows multiple light paths (modes), leading to signal dispersion.

<img src="/assets/images/session-1-figure-[1.16]-MultiModeFibre.png" style="margin:auto">

- **Step-Index Fibre**:
  - Abrupt change in refractive index.
  - Different light paths reach the receiver at different times.
- **Graded-Index Fibre**:
  - Smooth change in refractive index.
  - Reduces signal dispersion.

<img src="/assets/images/session-1-figure-[1.17]-GradedIndexFibre.png" style="margin:auto">

- **Single-Mode Fibre**:
  - Small core diameter (~10 µm).
  - Light travels in a single mode, reducing signal loss over long distances.
  - Preferred for long-haul communications.

## Limitations of Optical Fibre

### Attenuation and Decibels
- Optical fibres are highly transparent but experience some **attenuation** (signal loss) as signals travel.
- **Attenuation** is measured in **decibels (dB)** per kilometre.
- **Formula for Power Loss (or Gain) in dB**:
  
  $P = 10 \log_{10} \left( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right)$
  
  where:
  - $(P_1)$ is transmitted power
  - $(P_2)$ is received power
  
- Key values:
  - **0 dB** = no loss
  - **+3 dB** = power doubles
  - **-3 dB** = power halves

<img src="/assets/images/session-2-table-[1.2]-Spectral bands for OFC.png" style="margin:auto">

### Pulse Spreading
- **Pulse spreading** occurs when signals **smear out** over time, reducing data rates.
- **Causes:**
  - **Multimode distortion**: different path lengths cause varied arrival times.
  - **Chromatic dispersion**: different wavelengths travel at different speeds.
  - **Polarisation mode dispersion**: orientation of light affects speed.

<img src="/assets/images/session-2-figure-[1.22]-Multimode Distortion.png" style="margin:auto">

## Components of an Optical-Fibre Link

### Optical Transmitters and Detectors
- **Optical transmitter**: Converts electrical signals into light signals.
- Types of transmitters:
  - **Light-emitting diode (LED)**: Lower cost but less efficient.
  - **Laser diode**: Higher efficiency and speed.
- **Optical detector**: Converts light signals back into electrical signals.
  - Typically a **photodiode**.

### Optical Amplifiers
- Used to **extend fibre transmission distances** by amplifying signals.
- Types:
  - **Regenerators**: Convert optical signals to electrical, process them, and re-transmit.
  - **Optical amplifiers**: Directly amplify the optical signal without conversion.

## Copper Cable

### Transmission in Cables
- Electrical signals travel through copper cables without needing conversion.
- Signal speed in copper cables: **≈ 2 × 10⁸ m/s**.

<img src="/assets/images/session-2-figure-[1.26]-Electrical Circuit.png" style="margin:auto">

### Magnetic and Electric Fields
- Conductors generate both **magnetic and electric fields**.
- **Signal reflection** can occur, leading to interference.

### Crosstalk and Radiation
- **Crosstalk**: Unwanted coupling of signals between adjacent wires.
- **Shielding** helps reduce interference.

### Attenuation and Distortion
- Signal **attenuation** increases with cable length.
- **Dielectric loss**: Some energy is lost as heat.
- **Distortion**: Different frequencies travel at different speeds.

### Types of Copper Cable
- **Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)**:
  - Twisted wires help cancel out interference.
- **Coaxial Cable**:
  - Outer shield minimizes interference and radiation loss.

<img src="/assets/images/session-2-figure-[1.28]-TPair&Copper Cables.png" style="margin:auto">

## Radio Communications

### Bandwidth and Reception
- **Bandwidth**: The difference between highest and lowest frequencies in a signal.
- **Passband**: The frequency range a receiver can efficiently receive.

<img src="/assets/images/session-2-figure-[1.30]-Receiver curves.png" style="margin:auto">

### Properties of Radio Waves
#### The Inverse Square Law
- **Power decreases with distance** due to wave spreading:
  
  \[ P \propto \frac{1}{d^2} \]

  <img src="/assets/images/session-2-figure-[1.31]-RWaveExpansion.png" style="margin:auto">
  
#### Reflection
- Radio waves reflect off smooth surfaces.
- **Scattering** occurs on rough surfaces or small objects.

<img src="/assets/images/session-2-figure-[1.32]-SpecularReflection.png" style="margin:auto">

#### Absorption
- Radio waves **lose energy** as they pass through certain materials.
- **Higher frequencies** are more prone to absorption.

#### Diffraction
- **Radio waves bend** around obstacles or spread when passing through gaps.
- Depends on **wavelength** and object size.

<img src="/assets/images/session-2-figure-[1.34]-SpreadingDueDiffraction.png" style="margin:auto">

## Propagation of Radio Waves

### Propagation Models
- **Ionospheric propagation**: Used for long-distance, low-frequency communication.
- **Multipath propagation**: Causes signal fading at higher frequencies.
- **Path loss**: Power decreases with distance, sometimes as **1/d⁴**.

## Analogue Modulation

### Amplitude Modulation (AM)
- **Carrier wave amplitude** is varied by the modulating signal.
- **Formula for AM signal**:
  
  $v_{AM}(t) = v_m \cos(\omega_m t) \times v_c \cos(\omega_c t)$

  <img src="/assets/images/session-2-figure-[1.45]-AMWaveforms.png" style="margin:auto">
  <br>
  <img src="/assets/images/session-2-figure-[1.46]-SimpleMixer.png" style="margin:auto">
  <br>
  <img src="/assets/images/session-2-figure-[1.47]-FrequencySpectrum.png" style="margin:auto">
  
- **Sidebands**:
  - Upper sideband: $\omega_c + \omega_m$
  - Lower sideband: $\omega_c - \omega_m$
- **Bandwidth**: $B_{AM} = 2B_m$

### Frequency Modulation (FM)
- **Carrier frequency** is varied by the modulating signal.
- **Frequency deviation (Δf)**: Maximum deviation from carrier frequency.
- **Modulation index (β)**:
  
  $\beta = \frac{\Delta f}{f_m}$
  
<img src="/assets/images/session-2-figure-[1.48]-FMWaveforms.png" style="margin:auto">

- **Bandwidth**:
  
$B_{FM} = 2(1+\beta)f_m$

### Phase Modulation (PM)
- **Carrier phase** is varied by the modulating signal.
- **Similar to FM**, but the phase shift is the primary characteristic.
